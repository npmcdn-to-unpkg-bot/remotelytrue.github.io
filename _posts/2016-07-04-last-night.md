This was my first crossword (authored ~December 2014-February 2015), and it likely shows. Still, the theme amused me, and I know some Smiths fans actually enjoyed it (see [this review](https://aimlesslythemeless.wordpress.com/2015/02/11/guest-puzzle-last-night-i-dreamt-that-somebody-solved-me/) by the indispensible Lena Webb).
