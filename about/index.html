	<p>I'm Phil Steindel. I've got a Ph.D. in Biophysics and Structural Biology from Brandeis University, where I studied the evolution of some quasi-obscure proteins. Since then, I've been making my way into the bioinformatics and data science community, doing some projects along the way. I also love solving and (more recently) constructing puzzles, from crosswords all the way to stuff like the <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/">MIT Mystery Hunt.</a></p>

	Mainly, it's a Simpsons quote that seems to be inexplicably underutilized online, so I took it. Also, something something Bayesian statistics and the meaning of 'truth' and 'facts' and all that.</p>
